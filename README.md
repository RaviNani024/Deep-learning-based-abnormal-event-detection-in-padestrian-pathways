# Deep-learning-based-abnormal-event-detection-in-padestrian-pathways
In today's rapidly urbanizing world, public safety in pedestrian zones is of paramount importance. Monitoring these environments manually is not only resource-intensive but also prone to human error. Our project, Deep Learning-Based Abnormal Event Detection in Pedestrian Pathways, aims to address this challenge by leveraging the power of computer vision and deep learning techniques to automatically identify unusual or suspicious activities in pedestrian areas.
The goal of the system is to detect abnormal events such as people running in panic, falling, walking in the wrong direction, loitering, or sudden crowd gathering—events that may indicate emergencies, health issues, or security threats. The solution is intended to assist authorities and surveillance teams by providing real-time alerts, enabling faster response times and enhanced situational awareness.
This project is a collaborative effort by a team of five members, each contributing uniquely across multiple domains:
Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:
The team utilizes the UCSD Anomaly Detection Dataset, which is widely used for benchmarking pedestrian anomaly detection. This includes video sequences of normal pedestrian activity with occasional anomalies. The data is preprocessed by converting videos into frames, applying grayscale normalization, resizing, and background subtraction to highlight moving objects.
Model Design and Training:
The core of the system is a deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. CNNs are used to extract spatial features from video frames, while LSTMs help capture the temporal dependencies across frames, enabling the model to learn behavioral patterns over time. The team is also exploring alternative models like Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance anomaly detection performance.
Feature Extraction and Anomaly Detection:
Feature maps generated by the deep network are used to determine what constitutes “normal” behavior. Any significant deviation from this learned pattern is flagged as an anomaly. The system is trained to minimize false positives while maintaining high sensitivity to abnormal events. Techniques like frame-wise reconstruction error, temporal coherence loss, and optical flow are explored to strengthen the detection accuracy.
System Evaluation and Optimization:
Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as AUC-ROC, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. The team performs ablation studies to compare different model architectures and tuning strategies, optimizing both speed and accuracy. Real-world considerations like lighting variation, occlusion, and camera noise are also taken into account.
Deployment and Visualization:
For visualization and real-time analysis, a user-friendly dashboard is developed that highlights detected anomalies on live or recorded video feeds. The interface allows security personnel to review flagged events with contextual frames, timestamps, and anomaly scores. Deployment is simulated on edge devices to evaluate the feasibility of integrating the system with existing CCTV infrastructure.
Conclusion:
Our deep learning-based system offers a promising step towards automating surveillance and improving pedestrian safety in public areas. By combining advanced AI techniques with practical system design, our project demonstrates how technology can play a crucial role in proactive monitoring and intelligent decision-making. With future improvements and real-world testing, this system can be deployed in places like malls, campuses, metro stations, and public parks to significantly enhance safety and security.
